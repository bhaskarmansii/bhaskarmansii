**Hey there,** Mansi here!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here's a bit about me:

I'm a data science intern looking to transition into a full-time analytics role. My internship and experience in banking in fraud prevention and chargeback analysis have strengthened my passion for Data & Analytics. With my expertise in data extraction, transformation, and visualization, I have completed multiple projects.  I am confident in my ability to apply my skills to any project and deliver exceptional results. Now, I'm eager to leverage these skills and my internship learnings in a role that allows me to contribute to broader organizational goals through data-driven decision-making.

**My dream gig?**\
 I envision joining a team where I can apply my skills to bridge the gap between data and business challenges data, leading to impactful decisions that drive innovation.
